# challenge-6
This time you'll be working with a chunk of HTML similar to a blog post, but now you're in charge of the design. Create a colour scheme and layout that has a look and feel related to one of the following words:

Passion
Love
Funky
Creative
Elegant
Industrial
Gothic
Try using a background image that fits the aesthetic of your design, but remember to keep your text readable!

If you've started experimenting with CSS Web Fonts, this is a perfect place to use them. Font Squirrel and Google Web Fonts are excellent resources for finding decorative heading and body text fonts that are free to use.

For some inspiration, checkout the collection of Typography for Headlines

Hints:

You'll need to link your HTML to a new stylesheet.
Add some more content paragraphs if you like.
Try to use the HTML structure as-is, but add some extras if you really need to.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Headline Challenge</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="wrap">
      <div class="thepost">
        <h1 class="posttitle">CSS Layout</h1>
        <h2 class="dateheader">Monday, May 29, 2006</h1>
        <p>
          Wonder when CSS layout techniques will be less of an art and more of a science.  
        </p>
        <p class="postfooter">
          <em>Posted by Robin.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```
